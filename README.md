# Notes App

## Description: 
Create and store your notes for a later purpose!

## Current features
* User can create a note
* User can edit a note
* User can delete a note
* Notes are temporarily stored on the device
* User can see the date when he created the note
* Multiple notes can be selected/deleted

## Extra features to be implemented
- User can create and edit a note in Markdown format
- For the notes overview, a staggered gridview could be implemented
- Layout of the gridview can be changed

## Things I learned when developing this
- Pass data between screens
- Store data using shared preferences
- Expaneded my understanding of text fields

## Things I want to be improved on
- I noticed that I really suck at design
- I also want to try implementing different typogryphy
- The code base needs a lot of refactoring (which I intend to do continuously)
